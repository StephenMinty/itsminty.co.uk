This one's for all the animators/studios out there (incoming nerd chatter alert, non-animators move along):

I built this handy plugin for After Effects to save myself from having to manually write out an expression whenever I needed to loop something (pretty often!). Three buttons with Cmd/Shift/Alt-click options apply most of the loop expressions you'll ever need to your selected properties, saving you valuable seconds!

The plugin is small, pretty, and [free to download](https://gumroad.com/l/quickloop). Happy looping!
