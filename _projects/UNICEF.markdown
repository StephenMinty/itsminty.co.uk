This video was created to kick off a 2019 global leaders event in New York, hosted by End Violence Against Children. Led by UNICEF and their partners, this international coalition seeks to end all forms of violence in schools around the world through the Safe to Learn campaign.

I designed and art directed the piece for [Sandbox](https://www.sandboxinc.ca/), and animated it in collaboration with their internal creative team.

Executive Producer: Boaz Beeri

Art Director/Animator: Stephen Minty
