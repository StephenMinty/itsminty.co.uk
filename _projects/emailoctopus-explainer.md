EmailOctopus needed an explainer video that explained their product - low-cost email marketing - to potential customers in a way that reflected the clear, friendly feel of their brand. I did this by keeping the colour palette minimal, the screen space uncluttered, and with heaps of appealing transitional animations.

This project was especially satisfying to work on as I directed the whole project from concept, through scripting and storyboarding, to design, illustration, animation, sourcing audio, and the final edit.
