This introduction to Century Initiative, produced at Sandbox, was a really fun one as we had the excellent Matic Grgic (http://www.maticgrgic.com/) on development, art direction, and illustration, leaving me to focus my energy on the animation.

Camera moves were a big part to this piece - we wanted to feel like we're constantly moving forward to a bright future, which meant lots of long scenes and technically tricky parallax rigs!
