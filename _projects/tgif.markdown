For a couple of months last year, I challenged myself to create a weekly GIFs during my long train commutes, to be released each Friday. I called the project #tGIF (Get it? Anyone?)

Some turned out really well, some not as great, but I enjoyed the process and the freedom to experiment.

Here are a few of my favourites.
