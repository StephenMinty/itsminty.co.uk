[The Bristol Cable](https://thebristolcable.org/) is a media co-operative that produce investigative journalism that matters to the people of Bristol.

Being funded by their members, The Cable wanted to grow their membership with a referal scheme. They commissioned me to produce an animation to help them get the word out about this scheme.

Collaborating to help grow an organisation that I so strongly support was an honour, and a lot of fun to boot.
