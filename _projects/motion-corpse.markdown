[Motion Corpse](https://vimeo.com/motioncorpse) is an animation game, in which participants receive a single frame from which they create a short animation. The result is a seamless compilation of varying styles. Having only five seconds, I crammed in as much animation as I could!

Check out the video below for the full effect.
