When a snap general election was called in 2017, I wanted to do more than just rant within my online echo chamber - so I gathered a group of politically-engaged animator friends and organised the [#BeAVoteWinner](https://twitter.com/hashtag/beavotewinner) GIF campaign to get the young vote out. This animation was my message.

With an estimated 72% turnout of 18-24 year olds, I think it's fair to say we (almost) swung the election ;) üó≥Ô∏è
