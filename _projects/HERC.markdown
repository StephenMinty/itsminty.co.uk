I had the honour of designing and animating this film about Nancy Barnett Kennedy, the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, who keeps the stories and lessons of his experiences alive. Many thanks to Nancy, [HERC](http://holocaustcentermilwaukee.org/), and [Sandbox](https://www.sandboxinc.ca/) for allowing me to be a part of this important mission.
