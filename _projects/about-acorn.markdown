[ACORN](https://acorntheunion.org.uk) is a community based social justice union, organising low & moderate income communities to build people power and fight for the common good. Working with the team at Counterstate Films, I took their styleframes and animated them to create this short video to help ACORN communicate why and how they operate.

Produced, designed and directed by [Counterstate Films](http://www.counterstatefilms.co.uk) and [Scubaboy Inc](http://www.scubaboyinc.co.uk)
Animated by Stephen Minty
