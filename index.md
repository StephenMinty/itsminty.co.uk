#### Oh hey! Iâ€™m Stephen, a Bristol-based motion designer and animation director.

I'm constantly astounded by the power of animation to tell stories and communicate ideas in ways that no other medium can. I love getting swept up in compelling animation almost as much as I enjoy creating it myself.

Whether breathing personality into a brand through short-form social content, or directing a short film that communicates an important message and resonates with the right people, I love crafting animation that truly connects.

If that sounds like the kind of magic you need, please get in touch.
