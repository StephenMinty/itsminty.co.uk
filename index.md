I'm constantly astounded by the power of animation to tell stories and communicate ideas in ways that no other medium can. The only thing I like more than getting swept up in compelling animation is creating it myself. Whether breathing personality into a brand through a series of animated GIFs or directing a short film that communicates an important message and resonates with the right people, I love crafting animation that truly connects. If that sounds like the kind of magic your brand needs, please do get in touch.
