#### Oh hey! I'm Stephen, a motion designer and animation director from beautiful Bristol, UK.

{% include figure.html image="/uploads/WebsiteAvatar-1b2749.png" position="center" %}{: style="width: 50%; float: center;"}

I'm constantly astounded by the power of animation to tell stories and communicate ideas in ways that no other medium can. I love getting swept up in compelling animation almost as much as I enjoy creating it myself.

Whether breathing personality into a brand through social content, or directing a short film that communicates an important message and resonates with the right people, I love crafting animation that truly connects.

If that sounds like the kind of magic you need, please get in touch.
