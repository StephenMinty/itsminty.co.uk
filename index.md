#### Hi, I'm Stephen Minty, a freelance motion designer and animation director working out of a small bungalow in beautiful Bristol, UK.

I'm constantly astounded by the power of animation to tell stories and communicate ideas in ways that no other medium can. The only thing I like more than getting swept up in compelling animation is creating it myself.

Whether breathing personality into a brand through a series of animated GIFs or directing a short film that communicates an important message and resonates with the right people, I love crafting animation that truly connects. If that sounds like the kind of magic your brand needs, please do get in touch.
